# Local arm-pull first-step experiment (24 October 2026)

Opt-in only: `?pull-step=local` on loopback, then select Balance. Main/site and
ordinary Balance, passive and GetUp remain separate. This is not continuous
walking. The preserved old foot-cycle is not invoked.

Causal hypothesis: the former timer/angle cycle had no horizontal foot destination
and did not coordinate the joint shape with the measured support-relative COM.
A native-Jacobian reference for both tasks may transfer load and permit a first
step toward a real arm pull. Failure to unload, track the sole clearance or hold
the retained foot would refute this candidate; pure FK is not its validation.

Implementation uses existing native `mj_jacBody`, `mj_jacSubtreeCom` and Cholesky
routines, on separate MjData. The relative Jacobian removes common rigid root
motion, including support-frame rotation. No physical pose, velocity, contact,
model, motor limit or friction is changed. Fifteen existing trunk/leg hinges
coordinate COM XY, swing-foot position/orientation and torso orientation.
COM height is a secondary posture objective within30mm; it is not an obligatory
constant-height constraint. Iterative FK, active-ROM columns and monotone Hermite
interpolation verify a finite path. Quintic phase progress starts/ends smoothly;
intermediate FK nodes are not stops. Reference speed is measured, not claimed
as physical actuator authority.

The measured-shape trajectory qgeom is distinct from compliant servo reference
`qservo = nominalBalance + qgeom - qentry`. This retains Balance's existing PD
preload instead of cancelling it by capturing qactual. Servo ROM projection and
its residual are exposed. The COM feedback retains the initial equilibrium
offset and follows the same relative displacement in the measured stance frame.
The existing gains/caps and single torque owner remain. Total requests transition
from current nominal Balance over25ms, before final saturation. Ankle feedback
share follows measured contact load with50ms filtering, not a 1/1→2/0 phase jump.
This approximate preload does NOT establish that qgeom will be realized.

## Frozen single-run protocol

- One reset, Balance10s (8000 ticks); no other physical preparation.
- Existing `beginGrab/moveGrab/release` on left forearm body15 at local
  `[.09,-.09,.09]`; spring120N/m, damper12Ns/m, original180N force cap.
- Move the target WORLD+X by250mm using a smooth ramp over0.5s; keep its initial
  Y/Z. Hold that same world target, release3.8s after grab. No other force/push.
  This is a reproducible pointer-target profile through the actual grab force
  path, not an independently prescribed force or a mouse-input/mobile QA test.
- Forward traction>8N, dominant over lateral, AND capture proxy advances8mm
  from quiet COM or actual vx>0.02m/s triggers the plan. The capture proxy is
  indicative, not a viability proof. Right support/left swing for this first
  forward-only case; no alternating-step claim.
- Destination advance is clamped40–90mm from measured COM/vx/traction at trigger.
- Transfer nominal1.8s, unload≤2.3s. Left load<15N and right>100N continuously75ms
  before lift. Actual native contacts are never removed.
- Lift aims20mm whole-sole clearance; require actual minimum≥8mm and left load<1N
  for50ms. Lift deadline0.7s; transport0.6s; lower0.5s/reception deadline0.8s.
- Loaded reception>30N for50ms, return0.6s. Release before lift cancels and returns;
  in-flight release finishes landing. No new step on release.
- Success: observed unload, entire-sole clearance, ≥30mm advance DURING flight,
  loaded reception, both feet>30N, tilt<0.2rad and COM speed<0.03m/s continuously
  for the final1s after release. Sliding cannot substitute for flight advance.
- Retained foot drift>25mm, retained load<1N for25ms, nonfoot support,
  tilt>20°, existing measured fall, nonfinite/cap anomaly or phase deadline stop.
  Whole run≤16s/12800 actual ticks, forecasts0; interaction/calming≤6s.
  One attempt; no post-result tuning or physical retry.

Loads are from the last resolved substep; geometry is refreshed separately for
measurement and labelled. Joint torque actually transmitted is checked against
gear×ctrl and physical caps. Root generalized actuation and applied generalized
forces must remain zero. The only external body force is the disclosed grab.

## Validation scope

`node scripts/verify-mujoco-pull-step-pure.mjs` performs zero integrations,
including baseline command equality, relative-Jacobian finite differences,
finite path/interpolation/ROM, entry continuity, release and pre-integration
failure. It does not establish single-support or contact feasibility.

`node scripts/run-mujoco-pull-step.mjs <new-proof-directory>` is the exclusive
single-run runner; never invoke it without a separately authorized runtime.
It saves counters/poses progressively and a complete final native state. Proof
budget2MB; no media transfer or publication. Historical FAIL results remain.

## Observed single-run result — FAIL before transfer

Source40d62457dcaf22f96b3e9908f6ee7b978f944282. The only physical run stopped
at10.24375s /8195 ticks (8000 standing +195 with grab). The trigger did react to
real forward traction12.5995N and COM vx0.02057m/s, but the finite-path ROM check
rejected the measured initial shape before a transfer command was applied.

The native soft joint limits had allowed right/left knees to2.05042° /2.05698°
against the nominal2° bound. The input pose at path parameter0 is required to be
exactly the measured pose; the strict nominal-ROM assertion rejects that input.
This is a demonstrable initialization/validation mismatch, not evidence that
single support is physically impossible. The pure tests used a nominal-ROM seed
and missed this observed entry. No guard, gain, controller or cap was changed
following the result, and no retry was made.

At stop: COM+1.218mm forward since grab, torso tilt8.081°, right/left loads
195.840/203.680N; minimum whole left sole−0.748mm (native contact penetration).
No unload, lift, flight, placement or reception occurred; retained-foot drift
was0.038mm. Requested/applied motors stayed within the original caps; initial
reset landing had reached caps, while the largest at stop was60.42% of its cap.
No nonfoot contact or physical fall. The arm force remained an explicit user
grab, with no root/generalized assistance. The FK trajectory remains unvalidated.

Local proof directory `web/proofs/pull-step-001/`: progressive compressed trace,
ledger, exact native final checkpoint (pure state restore verified), diagnostic
and one inspected contact sheet. The sheet shows the full mannequin and floor,
with actual positions at0,10,10.05,10.125,10.2,10.24375s; it is labelled replay,
not a new simulation. No video/export/publication was produced.

MuJoCo confirmed total228054 PLUS the preserved prior unknown run; Rapier45735
unchanged. Main, remote branches and the private deployed site are unchanged.
Only this local experimental branch contains the candidate and its failure.
